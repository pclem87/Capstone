I spent many years with a person who treated me well, but she passed away recently and now I need a new home and a new family. I'm great with dogs but I get a little too excited around cats.",

I'm even quite around strangers and other animals (most of the time!). I'm eager to please, and better still I'm very friendly toward all sorts of animals and even children.",

I was abused and abandoned, but now I'm recovering and learning to trust again with the love and support of a foster family. I still have some work to do, especially learning not to panic when I hear loud noises, but if you're willing to give me the chance I'd like nothing better then to make you happy.",

I'm a bit older, but on the plus side I'm house-trained, great around strangers, calm around children, and have an unfailingly relaxed demeanor. I'm a bit of a couch potato, but I still love long walks. My one challenge is that I don't get along well with other dogs.",
